As traffic accidents continue to increase year of year, along with the population growth in many urban locations, it is important to understand the frequency and severity of these accidents.  Developing an understanding of historical accident data will enable experts to predict the severity and causes of traffic accidents in order to enhance driver safety.  By  predicting the number of accidents at a given time, we can aid in developing a solution to enhance driver safety, and promote safety awareness.  Through thoughtful analytics, and time series analysis, the goal is to present the trends of accidents per state and use this to predict the future totals, for this we've developed a visual aid, in the form of a web dashboard, that will enable users to visualize the results of our time series analysis. This will allow users to view results by state, and drill down to various time intervals.
